      <p class="list-group-item-text">In 2015 Cheerful Ghost published it's first game Starship Rubicon. Starship Rubicon is a modern take on the classic space shooter genre. It's a smart and challenging rogue-lite that features a unique control scheme, pixel art remixed with real NASA photographs, and an existential crisis about who is REALLY the monster.</p>
