<p>
  <div><strong>Cheerful Ghost</strong></div>
  <p>
    Created the social video game site <a href='http://cheerfulghost.com'>Cheerful Ghost</a> from concept to implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    "<i><a href='http://cheerfulghost.com'>Cheerful Ghost</a> is an indie website that was started January 2012. We are a close group of friends that love talking all manner of geek such as films, TV and video games. Cheerful Ghost also published the space shooter rogue-lite <a href='http://www.starshiprubicon.com'>Starship Rubicon</a>.</i>"
  </p>
</p>

<p>
  <div><strong>Starship Rubicon</strong></div>
  <p>
    Published the Indie rogue-lite space shooter <a href='http://www.starshiprubicon.com'>Starship Rubicon</a> through Cheerful Ghost.  Brought the game to the Steam, Humble Store, Itch.io & Desura stores to sell the game digitally.  Worked on a successful marketing campaign focusing on the game and it's unique gameplay.  Showed the game at various game conventions including Indie Game Con, Portland Retro Game Expo, OMSI After Dark & Game Masters. 
  </p>
  <p>
    "<i>Starship Rubicon is a modern take on the classic space shooter genre. It's a smart and challenging rogue-lite that features a unique control scheme, pixel art remixed with real NASA photographs, and an existential crisis about who is REALLY the monster.</i>"

<p>
  <div><strong>Zemus Gem</strong></div>
  <a href='https://github.com/jdodson/zemus'>Zemus</a> is a ruby gem that translates URLs into embeddable code you can insert on a page. It does its magic by simply inspecting and hacking up the URL itself, it makes no external requests to a web service. <a href='https://github.com/jdodson/zemus'>Zemus</a> is Open Source code hosted on GitHub and is available for you to use & modify.  It was extracted from Cheerful Ghost production code.
